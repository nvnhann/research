### Explanation

#### Efficiency

**Time Complexity:**
- **Building the Huffman Tree:** The time complexity for building the Huffman tree is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of unique characters.
- **Generating Codes:** The time complexity for generating the Huffman codes is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of unique characters.
- **Encoding:** The time complexity for encoding the input data is \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the input data.
- **Decoding:** The time complexity for decoding the encoded data is \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the encoded data.

**Space Complexity:**
- **Huffman Tree:** The space complexity for storing the Huffman tree is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of unique characters.
- **Encoded Data:** The space complexity for storing the encoded data is \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the encoded data.
- **Codebook:** The space complexity for storing the Huffman codebook is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of unique characters.

#### Code Design

- **Node Class:** Represents each node in the Huffman tree.
- **Priority Queue:** Used to build the Huffman tree efficiently by always merging the two nodes with the lowest frequencies.
- **Recursive Traversal:** Generates the Huffman codes by traversing the tree recursively.
- **Encoding and Decoding Functions:** Implement the core functionality of Huffman coding.

#### Readability

- The code uses proper Python conventions and is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of each function.
- Variable names are descriptive and indicate their purpose (e.g., `prefix`, `codebook`, `current_node`).
- The structure of the code is clear, with distinct sections for defining the tree, generating codes, and encoding/decoding data.
