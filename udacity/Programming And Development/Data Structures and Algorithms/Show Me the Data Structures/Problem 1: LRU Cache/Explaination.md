### Explanation for LRU Cache Implementation

#### Efficiency

**Time Complexity:**
- **`get` operation:** 
  - The `OrderedDict` in Python provides an average case time complexity of \(O(1)\) for accessing elements. When we use the `get` method, we first check if the key is in the cache, which is an \(O(1)\) operation due to the underlying hash table. 
  - If the key is present, we use `move_to_end` which, in the worst case, is \(O(1)\) since it involves rearranging pointers.
  - Therefore, overall time complexity of the `get` operation is \(O(1)\).

- **`set` operation:** 
  - Checking if the key exists in the cache is \(O(1)\).
  - Adding or updating a key-value pair in `OrderedDict` is \(O(1)\).
  - If the cache is at capacity, removing the oldest item using `popitem(last=False)` is also \(O(1)\).
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity of the `set` operation is \(O(1)\).

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the capacity of the cache. This is because the cache holds at most `capacity` number of key-value pairs. The underlying `OrderedDict` requires additional storage for maintaining the order, but this is also linear in terms of the number of elements.

#### Code Design

- **Choice of Data Structure:**
  - **OrderedDict:** The `OrderedDict` is chosen for its ability to maintain insertion order. It allows us to efficiently manage and update the LRU cache by moving keys to the end when they are accessed or inserted, and by removing keys from the front when the cache exceeds its capacity. This mimics the behavior needed for LRU caching.
  - The use of `OrderedDict` simplifies the implementation because it combines the functionality of a doubly linked list and a hash map in a single structure, ensuring both \(O(1)\) insertions/deletions and fast access.

- **Algorithm Choice:**
  - The `get` method includes moving the accessed key to the end of the cache to mark it as most recently used.
  - The `set` method updates the cache with the new key-value pair and ensures that the least recently used item is removed if the size limit is exceeded. This keeps the cache within its defined capacity while maintaining the order of usage.

#### Readability

- The code uses proper Python conventions and is well-documented with docstrings explaining the purpose and functionality of each method.
- Variable names are descriptive and self-explanatory, making the code easy to follow.
- The code is written in clear and concise Python, leveraging built-in libraries such as `collections.OrderedDict` for better efficiency and readability.
