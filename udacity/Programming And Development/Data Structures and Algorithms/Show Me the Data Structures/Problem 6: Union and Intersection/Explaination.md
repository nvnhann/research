### Explanation

#### Efficiency

**Time Complexity:**
- **Union Function:**
  - Converting the linked list to a set: \(O(n)\) for each list, where \(n\) is the number of elements.
  - Union operation on sets: \(O(n)\).
  - Appending elements to the result linked list: \(O(n)\).
  - Therefore, the total time complexity is \(O(n)\).
  
- **Intersection Function:**
  - Converting the linked list to a set: \(O(n)\) for each list, where \(n\) is the number of elements.
  - Intersection operation on sets: \(O(n)\).
  - Appending elements to the result linked list: \(O(n)\).
  - Therefore, the total time complexity is \(O(n)\).

**Space Complexity:**
- Both functions use additional space for storing sets and the result linked list.
- Therefore, the space complexity for both union and intersection is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the combined lists.

#### Code Design

- **Node and LinkedList Classes:**
  - Well-defined classes for creating and managing linked lists.
  - Methods for appending data, converting the list to a set for easy set operations, and converting the list to a printable string format.
  
- **Union and Intersection Functions:**
  - Convert the linked lists to sets for efficient set operations (union and intersection).
  - Create a new linked list to store the result of the union or intersection.

#### Readability

- The code follows proper Python naming conventions and is structured logically.
- Function names are descriptive and indicate their purpose.
- The `__str__` method in the `LinkedList` class allows for easy printing of the linked list elements.
