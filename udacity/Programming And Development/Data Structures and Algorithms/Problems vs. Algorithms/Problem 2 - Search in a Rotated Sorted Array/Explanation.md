### Explanation:

#### Efficiency:
The code achieves a runtime complexity of \(O(\log n)\), aligning with the requirement for logarithmic time complexity. This efficiency is primarily due to the use of the binary search algorithm:
- **Binary Search**: The code leverages the principle of binary search, which divides the array into halves iteratively, reducing the search space logarithmically.
- **Key Comparisons and Adjustments**: By making comparisons between elements at the start, middle, and end of the array, the algorithm effectively narrows down which half of the array to search in subsequent iterations.

Specific parts of the code contributing to overall efficiency include:
- **`while start <= end:`**: This loop repeatedly halves the search space, ensuring logarithmic performance.
- **`mid = (start + end) // 2`**: Calculates the middle index to use in each binary search iteration.
- **Conditional Checks**: By determining which half of the array is sorted and where the target number might lie, unwanted portions of the array are efficiently excluded.

#### Code Design:
The design choices in this code include:
- **Binary Search Algorithm**: The choice of a binary search algorithm is ideal for this problem, as it provides \(O(\log n)\) time complexity, which is necessary for efficiently handling large datasets.
- **Sorted Half Identification**: The algorithm identifies which part of the array (left or right) is properly sorted through comparisons, a crucial step in narrowing down the search space.
- **Conditional Handling**: It ensures the target is within the bounds of the sorted half before continuing the search there, optimizing the search process.
- **No Duplicates Assumption**: Simplifies comparisons and ensures deterministic behavior.

#### Readability:
The readability of the code is ensured through:
- **Clear Comments and Documentation**: In-line comments and the docstring explain the purpose of the function and the steps involved in the algorithm.
- **Descriptive Variable Names**: Variables such as `start`, `end`, `mid`, and `number` are self-explanatory, enhancing the clarity of the code.
- **Logical Structure**: The code is organized in a straightforward manner, with a logical flow from start to end, making it easy to understand and maintain.
