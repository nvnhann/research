### Explanation

#### Efficiency:
The code is implemented with a time complexity of \(O(\log(n))\), ensuring it performs efficiently even for larger input values. This efficiency is mainly due to the use of the binary search algorithm. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Given a number `n`:

- In each iteration, the algorithm checks the middle value (`mid`):
  - If `mid * mid == n`, the exact floor value of the square root is found.
  - If `mid * mid < n`, the search interval is narrowed to the right half.
  - If `mid * mid > n`, the search interval is narrowed to the left half.
- The search interval is repeatedly halved (`start <= end`), ensuring the algorithm runs in logarithmic time.

Specific parts of the code that contribute to this efficiency:
- `while start <= end:`: This loop runs logarithmically as the range is divided by half each time.
- `mid = (start + end) // 2`: Effectively finds the midpoint of the current search range.
  
#### Code Design:
The design choices in the code include:
- **Binary Search Algorithm**: The choice of binary search is ideal here since it efficiently narrows down the possible values for the square root by halving the search space in each iteration.
- **Handling Special Cases**: The initial checks for `number < 0`, `number == 0`, and `number == 1` cover the edge cases that simplify the rest of the logic and avoid unnecessary computations.
- **Intermediate Variable `ans`**: This variable keeps track of the highest integer whose square is less than or equal to the input number. This is crucial for obtaining the floor value when the exact square root is not an integer.
- **Meaningful Variable Names**: `start`, `end`, `mid`, `mid_squared`, and `ans` explicitly convey their roles within the algorithm, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

#### Readability:
The explanation and code are written clearly with proper English. Key points include:
- **Comments**: Inline comments provide context for the logic and decision points within the algorithm, such as handling special cases and narrowing the search range.
- **Clear Wording**: The code and explanation use concise and precise wording. Each step is clearly described to ensure that the thought process is transparent.
- **Structure**: The code follows a logical structure with proper indentation and spacing, making it easy to read and understand.
