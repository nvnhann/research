### Explanation:

#### Efficiency:

The provided solution efficiently finds both the minimum and maximum values in a list of unsorted integers using a single traversal. The overall efficiency can be summarized as follows:

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time complexity, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the list. This is because each element in the list is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: The algorithm uses \(O(1)\) space complexity, meaning it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. This is achieved by maintaining only two variables, `min_val` and `max_val`.

#### Breakdown of Efficiency:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `min_val` and `max_val` are both initialized to the first element of the list. This ensures a valid starting point for comparisons.

2. **Traversal**:
   - The loop iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, two comparisons are performed:
     - One to check if the current element is less than `min_val`.
     - One to check if the current element is greater than `max_val`.
   - Depending on the comparison results, `min_val` and `max_val` are updated accordingly.

3. **Return**:
   - After completing the traversal of the list, the algorithm returns a tuple containing `min_val` and `max_val`, which are the smallest and largest values in the list, respectively.

#### Design Choices:

1. **Single Pass Traversal**:
   - By traversing the list only once, the algorithm ensures that it runs in linear time. This avoids the need for multiple passes or additional sorting operations, which would increase the time complexity.
  
2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - Initializing `min_val` and `max_val` with the first element of the list simplifies the logic by eliminating the need for separate checks for an empty list within the main loop.

3. **Two Comparisons per Element**:
   - For each element in the list, only two comparisons are made. This keeps the number of operations minimal and ensures the efficiency of the algorithm.
