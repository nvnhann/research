### Explanation:

#### Efficiency:

This implementation is designed to efficiently insert words into the trie and subsequently retrieve suffixes based on prefixes. The overall efficiency of the code can be broken down as follows:

- **Insertion and Search Complexity**: Both insertion and search operations have a time complexity of \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the word or prefix. This is efficient and ensures quick operations even for large sets of words.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is dependent on the number of unique characters and the words being stored. The trie allocates new nodes only for new characters, which is space-efficient.

#### Breakdown of Efficiency:

1. **Insertion**:
   - The `insert` method iterates through each character of the word, creating a child node only if the character does not already exist. This leads to a time complexity of \(O(m)\), ensuring insertion is done in linear time relative to the length of the word.
   
2. **Search**:
   - The `find` method also operates in \(O(m)\) time by iterating through the prefix characters and navigating through the child nodes.

3. **Suffix Collection**:
   - The `suffixes` method uses recursion to collect all suffixes below a given node. The time complexity for this operation depends on the number of nodes below the given node, effectively traversing the sub-trie starting from that node.

#### Design Choices:

1. **TrieNode Class**:
   - **Children Dictionary**: Stores child nodes in a dictionary (`self.children`) for efficient lookups.
   - **Is End of Word**: Boolean flag (`self.is_end_of_word`) to mark the end of a word, important for correctly identifying complete words when collecting suffixes.
   - **Insert Method**: Adds child nodes as needed, ensuring no duplicate nodes for existing characters.
   
2. **Trie Class**:
   - **Root Node**: Initialized with a root node (`self.root`) to serve as the starting point for all insertions and searches.
   - **Insert Method**: Iterates through characters of the word and uses the `insert` method of `TrieNode` to construct the trie.
   - **Find Method**: Searches for a prefix by traversing the trie, returning the node representing the last character of the prefix.
