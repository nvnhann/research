### Explanation:

#### Efficiency:

The provided implementation of an HTTP Router using a Trie data structure is highly efficient due to its organized and strategic path storage and retrieval. The overall efficiency can be broken down as follows:

- **Time Complexity**: Both insertion and lookup operations in the trie run in \(O(m)\) time complexity, where \(m\) is the number of parts in the path. This ensures that routing operations remain efficient, even as the number of routes increases.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is optimized by the hierarchical structure of the trie, which shares common prefixes among paths, thus minimizing redundant storage and efficiently utilizing memory.

#### Breakdown of Efficiency:

1. **Insertion**:
   - The `insert` method in `RouteTrie` iterates through each part of the path, creating nodes as necessary. This results in a time complexity of \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of parts in the path.
   - Only new nodes are created if the path part does not already exist, contributing to efficient memory usage.

2. **Lookup**:
   - The `find` method in `RouteTrie` navigates through the trie based on the path parts, again operating in \(O(m)\) time complexity. If the path exists, the corresponding handler is returned; otherwise, `None` is returned.
   - The `lookup` method in `Router` handles trailing slashes and defaults to the "not found" handler if the path or any part of it does not exist.

#### Design Choices:

1. **Trie Data Structure**:
   - The `RouteTrie` and `RouteTrieNode` classes use a trie structure to store and manage paths. This choice leverages the common prefixes in paths, enabling efficient storage and quick retrieval.

2. **Path Splitting**:
   - The `split_path` method splits the path into parts using the `/` character, which aids in the traversal and insertion processes. This method ensures that paths are consistently processed, making the lookup and insertion straightforward.

3. **Not Found Handler**:
   - Including a "not found" handler adds robustness to the application, providing a clear response for unregistered paths. This prevents unexpected errors and enhances user experience.

4. **Handling Trailing Slashes**:
   - The `split_path` method is designed to trim trailing slashes and split the path into meaningful parts. This ensures that requests for `/home/about` and `/home/about/` are treated the same, adding flexibility to the handler lookup.
