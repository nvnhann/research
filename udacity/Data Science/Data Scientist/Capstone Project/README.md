My motivation for this project was to predict customer churn for Sparkify, a fictional music streaming company. The project involved loading and cleaning a subset of the available data (128MB), conducting exploratory data analysis to identify useful features, and performing feature engineering to create relevant features for modeling. I used machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes to build models.

The project includes an exploratory notebook and an HTML file to showcase the process and findings. The notebook includes markdown cells to explain each step of the process. Additionally, I wrote a Medium blog post that provides technical details of the project and the main findings. I determined that the Logistic Regression was the best model for this project based on the evaluation of F1 score and accuracy metrics, and the final model achieved an F1 and Accuracy score of 0.74.

The main findings of the code can be found at [here](https://medium.com/@nvnhan.dev/optimizing-churn-prediction-using-pyspark-8e9bf933b689) the Medium Blog post available here explaining the technical details of my project.

I would like to acknowledge Udacity for providing the project idea and workspace.
