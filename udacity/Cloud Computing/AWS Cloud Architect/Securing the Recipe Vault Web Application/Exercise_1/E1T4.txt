Based on the mentioned architecture diagram and the steps taken so far, here are two obvious poor practices related to security and their justifications:

- IAM Role with excessive permissions: The IAM Role (InstanceRole) has been granted full access to any S3 bucket instance. This violates the principle of least privilege, where roles should only have the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their intended tasks. By granting full access, the IAM Role has broad privileges that can potentially lead to unauthorized access, accidental data exposure, or malicious actions on S3 buckets. It is recommended to review and restrict the permissions of the IAM Role to only allow the specific actions and resources required by the application, following the principle of least privilege.

- Overly permissive security group rules: The WebApp security group allows ingress traffic from the internet to multiple ports, including ports 22 (SSH), 5000, and 80 (HTTP). This exposes the server to potential attacks and increases the attack surface. Additionally, allowing all egress traffic to any IP address without restrictions can potentially lead to data exfiltration or unauthorized communication from the server. It is best practice to restrict inbound traffic to only necessary ports and sources, implementing the principle of least privilege. Additionally, egress traffic should be limited to specific destinations and ports required for the application's legitimate communication needs.

By addressing these poor security practices, you can enhance the security posture of the application and reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or malicious activities.
