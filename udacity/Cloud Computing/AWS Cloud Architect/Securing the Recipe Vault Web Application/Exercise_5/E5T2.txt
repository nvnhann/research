Tools for Scanning Infrastructure as Code Templates:

- Regula: A tool for enforcing infrastructure as code security policies. It scans Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes files for misconfigurations and policy violations. (Link: https://github.com/fugue/regula).

- Terrascan: Specifically designed for Terraform templates, Terrascan scans IaC files to detect security vulnerabilities and compliance violations. (Link: https://github.com/accurics/terrascan)

- Chef InSpec: It allows you to write tests to validate the compliance of your infrastructure code and configurations against predefined security policies. (Link: https://github.com/inspec/inspec)

Example Vulnerabilities for Infrastructure as Code Templates:

- Server Side Encryption (SSE) not enabled: This vulnerability indicates that data at rest is not encrypted, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized access.
- Access logs not enabled for resources: This vulnerability implies that access logs, which provide valuable audit information, are not enabled for the relevant resources, hindering incident response and investigation.

Tools for Scanning AMIs or Containers for OS Vulnerabilities:

- Ansible: Ansible can be used to automate the scanning of AMIs or containers for OS vulnerabilities by running security-focused modules and playbooks against them.
Example Vulnerability for AMIs or Containers:

- SSH root access with password logon: This vulnerability indicates that the root user can access the system using a password for SSH authentication, which poses a security risk. It is recommended to disable root login or enforce key-based authentication.

Tools for Scanning AWS Environment for Cloud Configuration Vulnerabilities:

- AWS Config: It continuously assesses AWS resource configurations against desired rules to identify non-compliant resources and configuration vulnerabilities.
- AWS Inspector: It analyzes the AWS environment and provides insights into the vulnerability and security posture of EC2 instances, applications, and networks.
- AWS GuardDuty: A threat detection service that analyzes AWS logs and events to detect unauthorized access, malicious activities, and potential security threats.
Example Vulnerabilities for AWS Environment:

- IAM role assigned a policy that allows admin access: This vulnerability suggests that an IAM role has been granted excessive privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access and compromise of AWS resources.
- s3-bucket-server-side-encryption: This vulnerability indicates that server-side encryption is not enabled for an S3 bucket, leaving the data stored in the bucket unprotected.
- UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce: This finding indicates that an EC2 instance is being targeted by SSH brute force attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access and compromise of the instance.
