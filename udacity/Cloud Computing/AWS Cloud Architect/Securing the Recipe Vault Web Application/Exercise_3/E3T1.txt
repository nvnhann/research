AWS GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors your AWS environment for malicious activities and unauthorized behavior. In the case of the detected finding related to a brute force attack, GuardDuty analyzed the SSH activity and identified suspicious patterns that indicated an ongoing brute force attack.

To detect this attack, GuardDuty relies on various data sources and analysis techniques, including:

VPC Flow Logs: GuardDuty analyzes the network traffic flow logs generated by VPCs. By inspecting the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols, GuardDuty can identify anomalous SSH connection attempts and patterns indicative of brute force attacks.

DNS Logs: GuardDuty examines DNS logs to detect DNS queries associated with known malicious domains or IP addresses. This helps identify potential command and control servers or compromised systems used in the attack.

AWS CloudTrail Logs: GuardDuty leverages CloudTrail logs to gather information about API calls and AWS resource activity. In the case of brute force attacks, it can analyze SSH-related API calls to detect suspicious authentication failures or repeated login attempts.

Threat Intelligence Feeds: GuardDuty incorporates threat intelligence feeds from various sources, including AWS internal sources, partner feeds, and open-source intelligence. By correlating the observed SSH activity with known indicators of compromise (IOCs), GuardDuty can identify and flag potential brute force attacks.

In the specific case of the brute force attack finding you mentioned, GuardDuty detected that an IP address (10.192.10.75) was repeatedly attempting SSH login to the target EC2 instance (i-0ca8a7245eb78e8cc). The analysis of the SSH traffic patterns, authentication failures, and the rate of login attempts led GuardDuty to identify this activity as a brute force attack.

By continuously monitoring and analyzing the network and log data, GuardDuty can provide timely alerts and findings that help you identify and respond to potential security threats in your AWS environment.
