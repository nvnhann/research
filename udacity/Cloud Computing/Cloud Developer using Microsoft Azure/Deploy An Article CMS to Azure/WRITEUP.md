When choosing between a virtual machine (VM) and Azure App Service for deploying a CMS app, several factors should be considered, including cost, scalability, availability, and workflow.

1. Cost: App Service is generally more cost-effective, especially during the development and low-traffic production stages. With App Service, you pay for the resources allocated to your app, while VMs require provisioning and managing the entire virtual machine.

2. Scalability: VMs allow you to adjust the number of virtual machines based on demand, making it suitable for applications with fluctuating traffic. On the other hand, App Service offers flexible horizontal and vertical scaling, allowing your app to handle traffic spikes efficiently. This is achieved through auto-scaling features and load balancing.

3. Availability: Both VMs and App Service ensure high availability through load balancing, auto-scaling, and fault tolerance mechanisms. These features help distribute the workload and ensure that your app remains accessible even during high traffic or hardware failures.

4. Workflow: If your CMS app is relatively simple, App Service provides a more user-friendly setup experience. It integrates well with popular deployment tools and simplifies the deployment process. VMs, on the other hand, require more manual configuration and management, making them suitable for complex applications that require custom setups.

Based on these factors, the recommendation is to choose App Service for its cost-effectiveness, ease of setup, and scalability. App Service is well-suited for most CMS app deployments, providing a streamlined workflow and handling traffic fluctuations efficiently. VMs should be considered primarily when there is a need for intensive processing power or customization beyond the capabilities of App Service.

In summary, App Service is generally the preferred choice for deploying CMS apps due to its simplicity, cost-efficiency, and scalability. VMs are best suited for scenarios where high processing power or custom configurations are required.
