    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "## SVM\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are appropriate for this problem and can be a good candidate for classification tasks in general. Here are the answers to the questions for SVMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world application: SVMs are used in many real-world applications such as image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics. One specific example is the classification of proteins in bioinformatics where SVMs are used to identify potential targets for drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: SVMs perform well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes, the number of features is large, and the number of data points is small to moderate. They are also effective in handling nonlinear decision boundaries by using kernel functions. SVMs provide a unique solution because they find the best separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes, which leads to good generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: SVMs are sensitive to the choice of kernel function and the regularization parameter. The training time can be significant for large datasets. Also, SVMs can be prone to overfitting if the regularization parameter is not selected properly or if the dataset is noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidacy: SVM were selected for their suitability in handling high-dimensional data. As a result of the one-hot encoding feature transformation, which involved creating dummy variables, the dataset contained over 100 features. SVMs are known to perform well in such scenarios. Moreover, the dataset's size is not significant, with less than 100,000 records, which should not pose any issues for SVMs.\n",
    "## Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is a popular model used in various industries such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. One specific application is in credit scoring, where the model is used to predict the creditworthiness of loan applicants based on their financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can handle large datasets with high dimensionality and correlated features\n",
    "- Can handle missing data and maintain accuracy even with a significant number of missing values\n",
    "- Provides a measure of feature importance, allowing for better understanding of the dataset\n",
    "- Can handle both classification and regression tasks\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be slow to train and predict when the number of trees is large\n",
    "- May overfit the data if the number of trees is too large or if the data is noisy\n",
    "- May not perform well on imbalanced datasets with rare classes\n",
    "\n",
    "RandomForest are always a safe bet as they generally have high average accuracy rate for most cases and work well for complex classification tasks as well.\n",
    "## Gradient Boosting\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is widely used in various industries for a variety of applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fraud Detection: Gradient Boosting can be used to identify fraudulent activities by analyzing transaction patterns and predicting unusual activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommendation Systems: Gradient Boosting can be used to build personalized recommendation systems by analyzing user behavior and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image and Speech Recognition: Gradient Boosting can be used to improve image and speech recognition systems by training on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of Gradient Boosting include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High accuracy: Gradient Boosting is known for producing highly accurate models compared to other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles missing data: Gradient Boosting can handle missing data, making it suitable for datasets with incomplete information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles complex relationships: Gradient Boosting can handle complex nonlinear relationships between features, making it suitable for high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weaknesses of Gradient Boosting include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting: Gradient Boosting can overfit the training data, resulting in poor generalization on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slow training time: Gradient Boosting can be slow to train, especially on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires careful tuning: Gradient Boosting requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is a good candidate for the problem of predicting income from census data because it can handle complex relationships between features, handle missing data, and produce highly accurate models. Furthermore, Gradient Boosting is known to perform well on structured datasets with high dimensionality, which is the case for our census dataset with over 100 features after one-hot encoding.\n"
